# Linux Features, Tipps and Tricks for Non-Beginners
Linux is awesome for several reasons, and one of them is that it is full of nice features. Some of them are character device files (like /dev/random and /dev/urandom), while some other features are just really cool little packages that come with almost every linux distribution. Here, I list some of the cool stuff that you can find on almost any fresh linux install.

## 1 /dev/(u)random
/dev/random and /dev/urandom are both random-number generators, or perhaps more accurately: random-byte generators. Here are two example commands on how to use it:

    $ cat /dev/(u)random > ~/testfile

This will fill the file "testfile" in your home-folder with random bytes until you hit Ctrl+C. Be cautious, the file gets large FAST.

    $ touch /home/testfile
    $ dd if=/dev/(u)random of=/home/testfile count=2 bs=1024

This will fill a file "testfile" in your home folder with 2KB ($count times $bs bytes) of random bytes and then stop. Of course open that file with a simple text editor will not do much good, because the bytes will be interpreted as ASCII (or Unicode, or UTF-8, or ...) and will therfore look like gibberish. This leads me to the next cool built-in command:

## 2 hexdump
This command takes as input a file and outputs the file's contents in bytes. For example, when I run it on the testfile I just created with /dev/random, it returns: test

The first column describes the position of the line in the file in bytes, in hexadecimals. So, the second line starts at the 00000010_{hex} = 16th_{dec} byte in the file. 

The large middle column is the 16 bytes starting from the position given by the first column. Each byte is represented in hexadecimals and can therefore be represented by two digits.

The thirf, rightmost column is a representation of the bytes, interpreted as ASCII characters.

## 3 yes
This command outputs an endless string of "y\n", until you hit Ctrl+C. And the command

    $ yes yourword

will output an endless string of "yourword\n". This might seem weird, but it enables you to do some really cool stuff. Imagine you want to update your system. You know it will take forever, and you know you will have to hit ENTER (or press y) a couple times in places where the package manager wants your approval. In this case, you could do

    $ yes | sudo apt upgrade

or, as an Arch-based user:

    $ yes | sudo pacman -Syu

Such a use is of course ONLY advised if you ABSOLUTELY know what you are doing.

## 4 /usr/share/cracklib/
Cracklib is a library with ~470,000 common passwords. It's cool for obvious reasons, but also simply as a collection of random words.

## 5 2>&1 and how to search the whole system
This is a rather cool trick that I use fairly often. What does it mean? ">" redirects whatever is on its left-hand-side to whatever is on the right-hand-side. When putting "2" at the end of a command. it represents whatever is written to stderr, that is: any error message. "1" stands for stdout, so the classical command output which is to be printed in the terminal. So, 2>&1 redirects any error message to stdout. Why can this be useful?

I'm sure you've had this problem before: You want to search the whole system for a file, so what you would like to do is something like this:

    $ find / -name "filename"

However, this command will usually spit out a bunch of lines containing directories the find command was not allowed to enter, each line containing the phrase "Permission denied" at the end. This will even often happen when running the command with sudo, and it makes the find command's output useless. You might think about doing this:

    $ find / -name "filename" | grep -v "Permission denied"

but this would not change anything, as \| only pipes stdout, not error messages. So this command's output would look just like the previous one. Instead, when you pipe find's error messages to stdout, using \| you can pass them along as the input of the grep-command, like so:

    $ find / -name "filename" 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied"

And voil√†! You'll get a nice and clean output only containing the directory of the file you're looking for. 

## 6 Use Symbolic Links
This is not inherently Linux, but I realized that many top-level Linux users don't really bother about symbolic links, although they are super handy for a lot of things! For example, imagine you have a huge folder with scientific literature, and you also have another folder which contains all of your lectures and related material, like so for example:

    Desktop/Lectures/SpaceshipDesign/SpaceshipToilets
    Desktop/Lectures/PhilosophyOfMind/TheoryOfConsciousness
    Desktop/Literature/SpaceshipDesign/SpaceshipToilets
    Desktop/Literature/PhilosophyOfMind/TheoryOfConsciousness

This is obviously redundant, but I don't want to delete one of the redundancies, because I like to have my lectures and their associated content neatly in one place, as well as all of my scientific literature in general. In order to remove that redundancy, I simply remove one redundant directory (e.g. the lecture directory), and create a symbolic link to the directory I kept instead:

    $ sudo rm -rf Desktop/Lectures/SpaceshipDesign/SpaceshipToilets
    $ ln -s Desktop/Literature/SpaceshipDesign/SpaceshipToilets Desktop/Lectures/SpaceshipDesign/SpaceshipToilets

And now we still have both directories, without having to store the same stuff twice. 
N.B.: For scientific literature there are of course cool tools out there (zotero etc.), but you know, symbolic links are much cooler! Furthermore they are obviously generalisable to everything else.

## 7 cal
Just a nice little gimmick if you quickly want to know the day of the week of a specific day. The 15th of July 1990, for example, was a Sunday, see:

    $ cal 1990

## 8 !$ and !!
In bash, !$ stands for the last argument in the previous command, while !! stands for the whole last command. For example:

    $ ca file
zsh: command not found: ca
    $ cat !$

The above command will perform cat on file $file.
